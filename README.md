~~ECM-408-UNO-MIDI:  This uses [FortySevenEffects MIDI library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library/) and outputs via serial. Will need a virtual MIDI converter like [Hairless MIDI to Serial Bridge](http://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/). Compatible with the ATmega328 based Arduinos.~~

### TODO
* Create Mega version.
* Create UNO-MIDI-USB version that uses the DFU mod.
* Create Leonardo version.
* Create Due version.
